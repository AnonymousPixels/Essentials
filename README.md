# [Essentials](https://github.com/grunzwanzling/essentials)
A lot of methods that I and some other people need very often. Just look at it. There is almost certainly something for you.
There are also some other classes in this project that fit other purposes
* **SimpleLog**
A lightweight class that has various methods for logging into a file
* **Settings**
Easier reading from .properties or .xml files and saving them as soon as you change a setting. The main advantage is, that all the exception-handling is already done.
* **FileUtils**
Methods for safely deleting files or creating dummy files.
* **Security**
Methods for encryting stuff, hashing stuff or getting a HWID of the computer
* **WinRegistry**
Not my code. But useful for accessing the Windows Registry
